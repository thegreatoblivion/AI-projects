This project involves two species of the same "Creature" class, red and green. Reds are the predators and they reproduce by "eating" green, the preys. Green reproduces after a given amount of time with a birth rate and death rate. Every creature has a neural network which uses 2d raycast in Unity to give input to their surroundings and outputs their angular velocity and forward velocity. Each reproduction mutates their weights and biases slightly such that certain characteristics (like dodging) can be evolved.
